This app displays a list of filterable locations and their corresponding map
markers on a Google map. The app uses the FourSquare API to pull venues from
a nearby search and query. It also uses KnockoutJS to handle data binding and
code organization, and use Bootstrap 4 as a css framework.

This app is the "Neighborhood Map App" for the culminating project
for the Udacity fullstack nano degree.
